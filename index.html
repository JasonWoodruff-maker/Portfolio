        <pre class="about_info">
            My name is Jason Woodruff, and I am currently studying at Base Camp
          Coding Academy. Learning to code has been a dream of mine for a long
          time. However, my journey to get here has been a bit unusual. As a
          child, I moved around a lot, which meant changing schools frequently.
          This constant moving made it hard for me to stay in one place long
          enough to benefit from a consistent education, including any coding
          programs that might have been available. Because of this, I never had
          the chance to dive into programming when I was younger. Even though I
          faced these challenges, my interest in coding never faded. I was
          always curious and eager to learn, but without a stable school
          environment or coding classes, I had to wait for the right
          opportunity. Now that I’m at Base Camp Coding Academy, I’m finally
          able to follow my passion for coding with a lot of excitement and
          commitment.
